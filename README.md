# Experiments on social influence in decision-making in the absence of feedback
## Foundation
This repository is built on top of code produced by [Niccolo Pescetelli](https://github.com/chri4354) during his [PhD thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:04e42d0e-8133-4a4d-8fc0-27324876bfba), and those original scripts can be found on [his profile](https://github.com/chri4354/nofeedback_trust). The relative papers are under review or in preparation.

## Introduction
Previous work (see above) identified that, in the absence of objective feedback, people can use their own metacognitive information to evaluate the relative worth of advisors. Under certain circumstances this valuable heuristic approach leads to systematic errors. The code within this repository is for running MATLAB experiments to explore these errors and their consequences.
